## Decryption ABI note

Recovery itself uses the C++ runtime built from the OrangeFox source tree.
The Android 16 `libdmabufheap.so` prebuilt requires a newer libc++ symbol, so
its stock system runtime is isolated as `libc++_16.so`: both that library's
DT_SONAME and `libdmabufheap.so`'s DT_NEEDED entry have been changed to the
new name. `libion.so` is taken from the stock Android 16 recovery ramdisk.
